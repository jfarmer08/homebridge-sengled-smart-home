[![homebridge-sengled-smart-home: Sengled Connected Home plugin for Homebridge](https://github.com/jfarmer08/homebridge-sengled-smart-home/blob/main/logo.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/jfarmer08/homebridge-sengled-smart-home)

This plugin adds support for Sengled Smart Home devices to [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

This plugin uses the existing Sengled Element Home app infrastructure to allow you to control your Sengled accessories that uses zigbee. It'll let you turn on/off the lights and control brightness and color temperature using the Home app.

Provide your username and password and register as a platform, and it will auto-detect the light bulb you have registered.

Note that I only have **Element Classic A19 Kit (Light bulbs + Hub)** to test
